    <a href="https://github.com/ResidentMario/rubbish-geo">rubbish-geo</a> is a business intelligence backend I built as a freelance consulting project for SF-based trasher picker-upper startup <a href="rubbish.love">Rubbish</a>.

    It's basically a serverless API over a PostGIS instance hosted on GCP. Litter pickups are written to a Firestore user database by the client, then pushed to the analytics database using a database listener. The records are cleaned, counted, and aligned to the street grid, creating a blockface-by-blockface view of street litter:

rubbish=#
SELECT (name, curb, rubbish_per_meter, num_runs)
    FROM blockface_statistics
    INNER JOIN centerlines
        ON blockface_statistics.centerline_id=centerlines.id;
