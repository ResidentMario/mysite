    <a href="https://github.com/ResidentMario/airscooter">fahr</a> is a proof-of-concept Python CLI for training machine learning models remotely. Basically <code class="inline_code">fahr</code> does all of the work of packaging your model training script, shipping it on the cloud (via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">AWS SageMaker</a> or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kernels">Kaggle Kernels</a>), and reading back to local disk for you.
</p>

<p>
    <code class="inline_code">fahr</code> grew out of my experience trying to use AWS SageMaker (prior to its late 2019 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-studio-the-first-fully-integrated-development-environment-for-machine-learning/">SageMaker Studio</a> facelift) and finding it to be an incredibly frustrating developer experience. Curious if I could make something better, I built most of <code class="inline_code">fahr</code> over the course of three coffee-fueled days in January 2019.
</p>

<p>
    You need two files, a <code class="inline_code">requirements.txt</code> files specifying code dependencies (<code class="inline_code">conda.yml</code> is also supported), and a <code class="inline_code">.py</code> file defining the model training code. You call <code class="inline_code">fahr fit</code> to launch the training job, then <code class="inline_code">fahr fetch</code> to get model outputs.
</p>

<p>
    I later went on to work for <a href="https://spell.ml/">spell.ml</a>, an MLOps platform startup whose core offering provides a very similar product experience.
