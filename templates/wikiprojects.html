<p>
    Active editors on Wikipedia nominally organize themselves using WikiProjects, gathering-places for users
    with similar editing interests and experiences which serve to help bind together the specific
    sub-populations in the Wikipedian editing community. The effectiveness of these WikiProjects, however, is highly
    variable. Some, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Military_history">WikiProject
    Military history</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Video games">WikiProject
    Video games</a> are highly active and well-organized discussion-board-cum-communities. Some, like my home
    projects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Volcanoes">WikiProject Volcanoes</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Hawaii">WikiProject Hawaii</a>, are moderately
    active, but can seem lifeless at times. And some, like <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Nudity">WikiProject Nudity</a> (!), are graveyards.
</p>

<p>
    At their best, WikiProjects help keep Wikipedians addicted: they provide friendly, even sometimes joshingly
    competitive spaces in which any of a number of users interested in a topic can discuss and coordinate their
    effects, creating, in that communal atmosphere, a reason to stick with the project. However, speaking for
    experience, numerically speaking by and large few WikiProjects are truly all that effective. Which really is a
    shame, given the prevailing nervousness about the community's health: a healthy WikiProject infastructure would
    help keep the community more cohesive. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_X">WikiProject X</a> is an ongoing program led by a
    few experienced Wikipedians that is attempting to proactively refresh WikiProjects.

<h3>Sizing it up</h3>

<p>
    Dealing with the haphazard way in which WikiProjects organize their data turned out to be vaguely Herculean, and
    over the course of working through this data I had to write in logic for more cases than I ever imaginedâ€•an
    object lesson on how difficult it can be to clean an unpurposed dataset. My "in" was the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team">1.0 assessment scale ratings</a>,
    which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WP_1.0_bot/Tables/Project/Africa">charts</a> data for all
    WikiProjects. A lot of grease and a ridiculous amount of API and page requests later, I rolled up a list
    of (almost?) every WikiProject and their sizes.
</p>

<p>
    I now ranked the WikiProjects and plotted them according to size:
</p>

<img src="/static/wikiproject_articles_tagged_linear.png"
     style="width:800px; display:flex; margin:auto" alt="WikiProject X"/>

<p>
    Here when I mean size I mean the number of
    articles which the WikiProject covers. Large WikiProjects like the Biography or Military history one have a very,
    very, very broad basis of coverage; more narrow ones, like WikiProject Hawaii or WikiProject Seamounts, have a
    much narrower scope.
</p>

<p>
    The exponential distribution of WikiProject sizes is abundantly obvious: there are a few very, very large
    WikiProjects which dominate everyone else. Exponential curves like this one are far and away the norm amongst
    measures of online communities: academic analysis has demonstrated that almost all social networks follow
    something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law">Zipf-like</a> at scale. This graph on its own is not
    very informative, however. We can get a better sense of what's going on by looking at the log-log plot:
</p>

<img src="/static/wikiproject_articles_tagged_exponential.png"
     style="width:800px; display:flex; margin:auto" alt="Logarithmic graph of article distribution."/>


<p>
    Here you can see that WikiProject sizes are not at all log-normal: indeed, ignoring failed WikiProjects at the
    tip of the distribution the majority of WikiProjects fit into a prominent "bow" of larger-than-expected projects.
</p>

<p>
    Here are the 25 largest WikiProjects and their sizes:
</p>

<pre class="codesnippet">
    [('WikiProject Biography', 1353948),
     ('WikiProject United States', 423152),
     ('WikiProject Football', 273194),
     ('WikiProject Military history', 196951),
     ('WikiProject Film', 177418),
     ('WikiProject Australia', 158077),
     ('WikiProject India', 156128),
     ('WikiProject Cities', 132825),
     ('WikiProject Canada', 129344),
     ('WikiProject Years', 109213),
     ('WikiProject Olympics', 109007),
     ('WikiProject Africa', 106722),
     ('WikiProject France', 104831),
     ('WikiProject Lepidoptera', 98042),
     ('WikiProject Television', 96543),
     ('WikiProject Germany', 95924),
     ('WikiProject Poland', 89034),
     ('WikiProject Iran', 84132),
     ('WikiProject Geography', 80741),
     ('WikiProject National Register of Historic Places', 68779),
     ('WikiProject Ships', 65494),
     ('WikiProject Japan', 63350),
     ('WikiProject Baseball', 63252),
     ('WikiProject Russia', 62244),
     ('WikiProject Aviation', 61506)]
</pre>

<p>
    Just from a cursory examination of this list you can already get a sense of the biases at play on Wikipedia. Put
    yourself in the midset of your typical Wikipedian: according to a
    <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Editor_Survey_2011">2011 Editor Survey</a> you are overwhelmingly white,
    English-speaking (duh), male, and kind of a nerd (don't knock it 'til you try it!). What types of articles do you
    edit: ones on your local highway in Alberta or ones on a village in Africa? The beauty of Wikipedia is that it is
    such a comprehensive resource, covering a wider breadth of information than any other resource in existance. Its
    curse, though, is that, yes, an entire continent (Africa) gets less than a fourth of coverage that the United
    States does, and only two thirds that of Australia, a country with on the order of a fifthieth of the population.
</p>

<!--
<p>
    That's powerful. One of the things that I learned over the course of this project, however, is to take care with
    drawing conclusions based on WikiProject sizes. For instance, the Military history project is one of the largest
    on Wikipedia, with close to 200,000 articles. The History project, meanwhile, has 36,266. Why? Because there are
    far more editors interested in the specific subfield of military history than there are in history more broadly
    construed, and those editors have done a better job of curating their content
</p>
-->

<h3>Correlative strength</h3>

<p>
    Categorization was one of the most important meta-tasks in the early history of Wikipedia: Wikipedians then as
    now were very much interested in the how much and of what of their editing areas. Today the vast majority of
    Wikipedia articles are categorized according to WikiProject, most according to multiple ones: <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shield_volcano">Shield volcano</a>, for instance, is associated
    with WikiProjects in Volcanoes and Geology, while <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barack_Obama">Barrack Obama</a> has something like a dozen of them.
    I was interested in gauging the relative levels of overlap in content coverage for various WikiProjects. How
    often WikiProject Geology editors interact with WikiProject Mountains ones? How about WikiProject Alaska and
    WikiProject Glaciers?
</p>

<p>
    Here is the data I collected for one particular example, WikiProject Volcanoes:
</p>

<img src="/static/wikiproject_volcanoes_correlated_articles.png"
     style="width:800px; display:flex; margin:auto" alt="WikiProject Volcanoes correlations"/>

<p>
    Most of this shouldn't be too surprising: associated features and countries with many active volcanoes dominate
    the rankings (many other smaller correlations were omitted).
</p>

<p>
    However, this turned out to be a hard question to answer: not because the necessary queries were difficult to write,
    but because the raw volume of API requests necessary for thorough classification are out of immediate reach. I
    measured correlation by sampling a WikiProject's pages and then parsing the templates on their talk pages for
    connections to alternative WikiProjects. After playing around with the data for some time I realized that to
    construct a meaingful dataset this way I would need to analyze the top 500 or so projects: a task which would
    require, the way the code is currently written, over a hundred thousand API queries. This is simply too much scale
    for me to manage for the moment.
</p>

<p>
    Nevertheless, here's a gallery of some of my favorites:

    That's all for now, folks!
