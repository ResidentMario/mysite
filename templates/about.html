<p><div style="padding-left:100px; padding-right:100px;">"She knows, now, absolutely, hearing the white noise that is London, that Damien's theory of jet lag is correct: that her mortal soul is leagues behind her, being reeled in on some ghostly umbilical down the vanished wake of the plane that brought her here, hundreds of thousands of feet above the Atlantic. Souls can't move that quickly, and are left behind, and must be awaited, upon arrival, like lost luggage."<br/><span style="float:right; font-size:12px">&mdash; William Gibson, Pattern Recognition</span></div></p>

<p>I am a Python programmer and an undergraduate student of mathematics attending <a href="http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/">CUNY Baruch College</a>. My interests lie in the computational applications of statistics and probability; this website is meant to serve as a collection space for my ruminations on topics in data science, web programming, mathematics, and whatever other sorts of mischief I get myself into. I am also an English minor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Resident_Mario">avid Wikipedian</a>, and journalist thereof.</p>
