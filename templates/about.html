<p>
    I am a data analyst and software developer with strong interests in data science, visualization, and engineering;
    and in civic open data. An acute civic and open data junkie, I love working to make sense of and build useful
    results with public records data. This website is a collection space for ruminations on topics in programming, data
    science, data engineering, mathematics, and other such mischief. In my spare time I also enjoy playing tennis.
