<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
    One of the most compelling trends in technology today is the open data and open governance
    movement. It's not without reason that no less than Tim Berners-Lee himself, the creator of the worldwide web
    and one of the most preeminent scholars of the Internet, is doing his latest work in getting more government
    data on the web:  <a
        href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/the-webs-inventor-regrets-one-small-thing/?_r=0">
    in an interview with <i>The New York Times</i></a> a few years ago he spoke to how even records as mundane as
    traffic statistics or weather data could drive tinkerers to "make government run better".
</p>
<p>
    New York City has been at the forefront of this movement: mayor Bloomberg (you know, the guy that founded
    <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/">the largest multinational information broker in the world</a>) formalized
    a citywide analytics team as the <a
        href="http://www.governing.com/blogs/bfc/gov-new-york-city-data-driven-governance.html">Mayor's Office
        for Data Analytics</a> in 2013, and the effort has continued under Mayor De Blasio, with the city cementing
    its first <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/analytics/index.page">Open Data Plan</a> in July 2015. The
    resultant <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/">NYC Open Data Portal</a> is populated with over 1300
    well-maintained datasets.
</p>

<p>
    One of the most hotly requested of these is the <a
        href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">motor vehicle
    collision dataset</a>, a record of all motor vehicle collisions recorded by the NYPD going back to January 2012.
    This data was so hotly desired (by everyone from journalists to computer geeks) that prior to release an
    entire <a href="http://nypd.openscrape.com/#/">scaper project</a> existed for recompiling and enriching
    incident reports which had previously been <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/traffic_reports/motor_vehicle_collision_data.shtml">locked into
    PDFs</a> (where data goes to die) or <a
        href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/nyc-opens-traffic-crash-data-finally/">unavailable except by legal
    request</a>.
</p>

<p>
    For this project I looked at how this crash data can be used to reduce traffic fatalaties in New York City. The
    challenge: use data to find ways of helping to reduce the number of fatal crashes in New York City. Massive
    credit goes here to classmate, teammate, and fellow math nerd Anthony Campanello, who did the wet-work of
    actually generating the visualization used for this project.
</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>
    The <a href="http://project.wnyc.org/traffic-deaths-2015/">Mean Streets Project</a> recorded a total of 242 fatal
    traffic crashes in 2015, a historic low for the city in a figure that has been in slow decline as the years go
    by. Minimizing this figure, under the auspices of the <a
        href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/home/home.shtml">Vision Zero campaign</a>, has been one of the
    key aims of the De Blasio administration; this included initiatives like <a
        href="http://www.wired.com/2014/11/lowering-nycs-speed-limit-just-5-mph-can-save-lot-lives/">lowering the
    Manhattan speed limit</a> to 25 MPH (from 30 MPH), and the initiative overall is seen as having been modestly
    successful in its aims.
</p>

<p>
    Every time the NYPD is called to the site of a traffic accident, the responding officer fills out and files a
    MV-104AN report. This is a chunky form (which you can <a
        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mv-104an&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">examine yourself</a>) with thirty mostly
    numerical values to fill in, ranging from pedestrian action at time of incident and apparent contributing factors
    to the physical condition of the victim(s). This information has been compressed, for the purposes of
    anonymization and analysis, into date, time, coordinates, streets, vehicle types, and contributing factors.
</p>
<p>
    There are <b>over 750,000 data points</b> in the dataset (769054 in this analysis), representing crash reporting
    going all the way back to January 2012. Not every accident results in a report: the NYPD are called to the scene
    of an accident usually only specifically when it is useful, for insurance purposes, for there to exist a record
    of the accident, and so there is likely some number of unreported self-induced accidents&mdash;the NYPD form
    calls these "collisions with fixed objects"&mdash;which are not represented in the dataset.
</p>

<p>
    Officers file geographic information in terms of the street or intersection at which the accident occurred,
    so it's unclear how the coordinates in the dataset were geocoded. Date, time, contributing factors, and the
    distribution of injuries or deaths are the only columns present in every data point. Some data points lack
    coordinate data but have street data, some lack street data but have coordinate data, and some lack both. As
    expected, it's a bit of a mess: there are even a number of rows which do not indict any vehicle at all in the
    accident! The number of records for each column is summarized in the table below.

<p>
    As expected, the data took a little bit of effort to clean up and enrich. I used Python to merge the date and
    time columns into a single datetime column and used the <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro">Google Geocoding API</a> to attach
    coordinates to recorded fatalaties which had street data but lacked coordinates, of which there are approximately
    150 (!). In a few cases there were records in which fatalities occurred but for which there was <i>no geographic
    information whatsoever</i>. That data was definitely present in the filing officers' reports&mdash;it's almost
    shameful that such empty entries exist in the publicly accessible dataset!!!
</p>

<p>
    I considered extending this to injury data as well, but calculated that doing so would require up to 15,000
    geocoding requests. This is a scary large number, somewhere over half of the daily free allotment (25,000) that
    Google provides and probably several hours worth of computation time. More to the point, it wouldn't add
    anything to the analysis: this is so many entries missing the data that we can expect them to be just as
    scattered as the valid entries, so we can use the latter to also drive conclusions about the former anyway.
</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
    Reams and reams and reams of reports, filings, and research studies have been done on the causes and trends
    behind vehicular deaths in New York City and the wider world alike, and so even though one could derive a lot of
    insights by looking through the contributing factor and vehicle types in this dataset we elected to focus
    elsewhere. The causes and outcomes of automobile accidents are well-known and hard to address, and we found it
    easier to focus on an aspect of the problem which is much easier to fix&mdash;its geography.
</p>

<p>
    We used <a href="http://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> to visualize traffic fatality hotspots in the city.
    In the following visualization, coordinates in the dataset that get geo-tagged multiple times are represented by
    size: the more reports, the wider the circle. The color of the circles, on the other hand, indicates the
    accident deadliness at that location: the redder the circle, the higher the average number of deaths per
    accident. Together this provides us with a summary of especially dangerous accident locations in the city.

<p>
    Hover over the circles to see more information about the specific location in question. Use the "Average
    Fatalness" filter to adjust the range of dangerousness represented in the data: if you set the minimum to 0.0 the
    software will plot every single accident in the city; if you set the maximum to 1.0 it will include "singleton
    points", places where only a single accident occurred but that lone accident was deadly (these are unlikely to be
    addressable due to external factors and are mostly distributed by chance). Use the "Count" filter to filter the
    number of accidents per site: again, setting this to 1 will plot every single point, while raising it to a high
    value will plot only the most accident-prone locations.
</p>

<p><b>
    The larger and brighter the circle, the stronger the evidence that that specific
    location is inherently unsafe&mdash;and needs addressing.
</b></p>

<p>
    This visualization is of course not definitive, but it gives us a strong basis from which we may begin
    the fieldwork of investigating particular trouble spots and seeing what makes them dangerous.
</p>

<h3>Case Study #1: Getting on the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges Sucks</h3>

<p>
    <code class="code_inline">(40.69603, -73.98453)</code> in DUMBO is the site of more accidents than any other
    location in New York City&mdash;a whopping 585 of them&mdash;<b>more than a hundred accidents a year</b>.
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions/DUMBO%20Accident%20Location%20Google%20Maps.png"
     class="inline_image_full" alt=""/>

<p>
    The Google Street Maps view immediately reveals what makes this location so accident-prone. This intersection is the
    first major street intersecting the off-ramp of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, a major arterial road for which
    this is the last exit before the Manhattan <b>and</b> Brooklyn bridges. Drivers commuting to or from Manhattan
    get off here and merge with locally inbound drivers also getting onto <b>both</b> bridges.
</p>

<p>
    Considering that these two bridges together carry a huge chunk of the daily traffic into and out of Manhattan,
    all of which must merge on this one street, it seems obvious that such a problem would occur. Accidents at the
    foot of the bridges are so common that they likely have a significant negative impact on access to the bridges, and
    one wonders how tired the local NYPD precinct&mdash;located quite literally down the block&mdash;gets of getting
    called to this location. This is a horrible, mostly un-fixable intersection: of course the builders of the bridges
    were not aware of modern traffic concerns when they were completed in 1883 and 1909, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Case Study #2: The Queensboro is Hardly Better</h3>

<p>
    Proving that bridge designers are equal-opportunity muck-ups, the second most accident-prone location in the city
    (and the most accident-prone one in Manhattan), with 472 accidents total (still over 100 a year), is the
    Manhattan on-ramp of the Queensboro Bridge.
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions/Queensboro%20Accident%20Location%20Google%20Maps.png"
     class="inline_image_full" alt=""/>

<p>
    The NYPD does seem to be doing its best keeping things moving, though. If there's any location that needs a 24/7
    traffic officer it's this one.
</p>

     class="inline_image_full" alt=""/>


<h3>Case Study #3: Atlantic Avenue and the Van Wyck Expressway, Richmond Hill, Queens</h3>

<p>
    Only one of the accidents amongst the two locations above was fatal (a motorcycle impact at the Brooklyn-Manhattan
    on-ramp), so even though there are lots of accidents there, these accidents are very very rarely fatal. The
    following location, the site of 44 accidents in the past four-and-a-half years, was the site of <a
        href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/5-dead-in-accident-on-van-wyck/">a particularly deadly
    accident which killed five</a>&mdash;single-handedly making it the location of more motor accident deaths than any
    other in New York City.
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions/Richmond%20Hill%20Accident%20Location%20Google%20Maps.png"
     class="inline_image" style="width:800px;" alt=""/>

<p>
    A short traffic-controlled overpass on a major street (Atlantic Avenue) merging into a single
    lane, intersecting the entrance onto a major expressway (the Van Wyck), with the bonus industrial chic of a
    train overpass into an adjacent train yard? Yikes!
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions/Richmond%20Hill%20Accident%20Location%20Street%20View.png"
     class="inline_image" style="width:800px;" alt=""/>

<p>
    The perennial New York City construction probably doesn't help.
</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>
    The intersection in case study #3 is the only place in the city to have suffered five deaths; another location at
    the water's edge in Astoria <a
        href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-creek-car-sinking-4-die-driver-escapes-911-article-1.1746727">killed four</a>
    in 2014. There are three locations which suffered three fatalities, a small enough number that these accident
    locations can be ascribed to chance. 25 locations have been the site of two deaths and 912 have been the site of
    one deaths, for a total of 980 geographically-isolatable fatalities.
</p>

<p>
    There are no points in New York City which are in and of themselves outstandingly dangerous, and so there's no
    way to say concretely that any one location is "the worst"&mdash;and, thankfully, this is to be expected, as any
    such location would have either long ago been addressed, or, more likely, never have been built at all.
    Preventing accident pile-on points, on the other hand, seems to have proven to be a much harder task.
</p>

<p>
    This visualization is nevertheless useful for is constructing an understanding, neighborhood-by-neighborhood, of
    which areas and intersections in the area are most troubling. Try browsing through your own neighborhood,
    workplace, or commute. What areas did you expect would be problematic? Were you correct in your supposition? Which
    areas surprised you? Why is that?
</p>

<p>
    Want to try working with this data yourself? The dataset takes a while to process and is large enough to exceed
    GitHub's filesize limit. So generate it yourself: clone <a
        href="https://github.com/ResidentMario/motor-vehicle-collisions">the responsible repository</a> and run <code
        class="inline_code">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions.ipynb</code> to regenerate the enriched dataset
    from scratch.
