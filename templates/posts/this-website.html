	<p>
		I've been kicking around the idea of creating my own website for some time now. I started learning how to
		use Python's <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework early this summer, while working on a
		few publication scripts for the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost">Wikipedia Signpost</a>. The application
		I was hoping to build and deploy on <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/">Wikimedia Labs</a> still isn't quite
		finished: converting a bunch of scripts meant to be run by hand into a series of scheduled jobs on a server
		somewhere is far harder to dive into than I thought it would be. Still, that project progresses, albeit
		slowly (watch <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/signpostlab/">this space</a>).
	</p>

	<p>In the meantime I put the skills to use building a home on the web for a CUNY Baruch on-campus organization
		that I'm active in, the <a href="http://www.baruchmathematicssociety.com/">Mathematics Society</a>. What I
		love about the Flask microframework is the lightness: packages exist for handling most or all of the issues
		you run into in web programming, but they're hovering in the background of what you're doing, and never
		intrude. I love Squarespace (and their office seems like a dream to work in) but for a first effort I
		preferred, for my own elucidation, to create something handbuild.
	</p>

	<p>After I finished <i>that</i> project, it seemed only a matter of time until I turned to creating a personal
		one as well: and now it has arrived! This website, like the one for the Mathematics Society that preceded,
		is a static (so far) no-fluff handbuilt project developed in Flask-Python. You can see the <a
				href="https://github.com/ResidentMario/mysite">source code</a> on GitHub. I use <a
				href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> as my webhost. Math formulae are rendered
		with <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. iPython notebooks I host on <a
				href="https://github.com/ResidentMario">GitHub</a> and render via <a
				href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/">Jupyter</a>. Blog commentary is powered by <a
				href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.</p>

	<p>So there you go: from zero to semi-reasonable hero in a few months' hacking. Here's to years more of the same
		to come.</p>
