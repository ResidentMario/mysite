    Back in March 2014 New York City's bikeshare system, Citi Bike, <a
        href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2014/03/31/new-citi-bike-data-on-individual-trips-shows-how-bike-share-links-to-transit/">publicly released data</a>
    on trips taken using their bikes. It didn't take long for mappers to get their hands on it; a <a
        href="http://oobrien.com/2014/04/5-5-million-journeys-at-nyc-bike-share/">really beautiful-looking geographic
    volume plot</a> (geographic Sankey diagram?) came out just a couple of months later, depicting street routes taken
    by Citi Bikes in the city by volume. The map was made by Oliver O'Brien, a researcher at University College London.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately Citi Bike has been through a major expansion since then, and this data is now out of date.
</p>

<p>
    Here's an updated current version:
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/citibike-map/citibike-sankey-2016-poster.png" class="inline_image_full" alt="Data."/>
</a>

<p>
    Data is the same used for my <a href="http://www.residentmar.io/2016/08/27/day-in-the-life-of-citibike.html">Life
    of CitiBike</a> project, technically two orders of magnitude fewer trips, but still more than good enough. The
    most important caveat is the same: this map uses idealized routes generated by the Google Maps API, which may
    differ from the actual, perhaps more circuitous routes bikers take.
</p>


<p>
    Try bringing up the <a
        href="http://oobrien.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nycbikeshare_journeys.png">old map</a> and the <a
        href="/static/post_assets/citibike-map/citibike-sankey-2016-poster.png">new one</a> and comparing the two.
    You may notice that there are some significant differences!
</p>

<p>
    Sadly this map, too, is already technically inaccurate&mdash;<a
        href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2016/08/01/major-citi-bike-expansion-starts-today/">another major CitiBike
    station expansion began this August</a>.
