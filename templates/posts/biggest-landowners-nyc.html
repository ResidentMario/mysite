    An important and oftentimes conscientious aspect of a city’s social fabric is the way in which it houses its
    residents; you can learn a <i>lot</i> about a city from its real estate, and nowhere is this more true than it is
    in New York City.
</p>

<p>
    In this post I used data from the New York City Department of Planning's <a
        href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page">NYC PLUTO dataset</a>, a
    massive dataset containing building-granularity information on every so-called "Borough Block
    Lot" identifier in New York City, and the <a
        href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-assessments.page">RPAD dataset</a>, the New York
    City Department of Finance's record of property value assessments, to try to answer a basic question that's
    proven to be very popular in the media: <b>who are the biggest landowners in New York City?</b>
</p>

<!--<p>-->
    <!--When the dataset was first released in 2013 it represented an unprecedented-->
    <!--level of detail on the structure of New York City as well as a <a-->
        <!--href="http://www.wired.com/2013/08/nyc-pluto-data-map-party/">much-heralded win</a> on the part of the city's-->
    <!--open data community (see <a href="http://andrewxhill.com/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/pluto/#0">Andrew Hill's-->
    <!--tour</a> for a succinct tour).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Thanks to the murky waters of the real estate ownership business, the public record can't exactly tell you, for-->
    <!--example, how much money Donald Trump has invested in New York City real estate. We can nevertheless draw some-->
    <!--interesting lessons from what we find.-->
<!--</p>-->

<h3>Counting Addresses</h3>

<p>
    If by "largest" you mean "owner of the most unique addresses" (on further consideration a pretty terrible metric,
    but nevertheless an interesting place to start), here are the top ten raw winners:
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/landowners/top-ten-most-enumerate-landowners-raw.png"
     class="inline_image_full" alt="Data."/>

<p>
    Somewhat unsurprisingly <a>the single largest property-holder in New York City is city government</a>, with various
    agencies taking all but one of the top 10 and most of the top 50 slots. The sole exception
    is sixth biggest property-owner <code class="inline_code">OWNER / AGENT</code>—a mildly alarming
    instance of indeterminate ownership in the public record. There is also an option for the 33 properties in the
    city for whom an owner is apparently simply <code class="inline_code">UNKNOWN</code>.
</p>

<p>
    However, the public record of public asset ownership is a little haphazard. In additional to dedicated
    points for each of the individual city agenices there are several variations on "the City of New York"
    (<code class="inline_code">CITY OF NEW YORK</code>, <code class="inline_code">THE CITY OF NEW YORK</code>, etc.), and a
    similar situation exists for federal and state agencies,
    which are listed either individually or as part of the <code class="inline_code">UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT</code>,
    <code class="inline_code">NEW YORK STATE</code>, or even <code class="inline_code">THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE
    OF NEW YORK</code>. To explore the raw data yourself, <a
        href="https://gist.github.com/ResidentMario/387694c44045b3601c0fac8eee46f52f">check out this Gist</a>.
</p>

<p>
    It's easier for us to examine private entity data. A <a
        href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/nyregion/fyi-531286.html">Q&A published in The New York Times in
    1994</a> fingers
    Columbia University, NYU, Trinity Church, and a handful of developers as the biggest in terms of private
    addresses held. What does the picture look like today? Filtering out public services, here is what the public
    record has to say about the 20 private owners with the largest number of buildings:
</p>

<!--<img src="/static/post_assets/landowners/top-twenty-most-enumerate-private-landowners.png"-->
     <!--class="inline_image_full" alt="Data."/>-->

<iframe src="{{request.url_root}}most-enumerate-landowners-geo-visualization.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
        scrolling="no" style="width:960px; height:600px; border:0; overflow:hidden;"></iframe>

<!--<p>-->
    <!--<b>Columbia University easily owns more individual addresses than any other private entity in New York City</b>,-->
    <!--with over 200 properties to its name. NYU comes in distant second place with 95 addresses, followed by the shady-->
    <!--Duestche Bank National Trust (on which almost nothing can be found online, signs pointing to a foreclosure-->
    <!--clearing house). For the purposes of comparison Columbia's count is, for example, almost triple the 72 addresses-->
    <!--allotted to the New York Public Library system.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--The rest are an very interesting blend of large utility companies, church groups, private brokerage firms,-->
    <!--affordable housing corporations and non-profits, and, further down the line, private investors. Indeed, the data-->
    <!--points to a more heterogeneous ownership situation than I had expected. <b>Almost four-fifths of addresses in New-->
    <!--York City are owned by organizations or individuals who own no other property</b>.-->
    <!--&lt;!&ndash;17th-most-enumerate real estate owner Clinton Graham, for instance, has <a&ndash;&gt;-->
        <!--&lt;!&ndash;href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/79636-huge-rezoning-planned-for-jamaica-queens/">a very interesting&ndash;&gt;-->
    <!--&lt;!&ndash;story</a> behind his consolidation of properties in Jamaica, Queens.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    Why aren't there more, or indeed, almost any, large corporations on the listing? Because even though many
    companies call New York City their home, either or both in workforce and in headquarters, <b>corporations own very
    little of the land they use</b>. Companies strongly prefer renting or leasing their space instead. Wells Fargo is
    seemingly the largest casually recognizable corporate landowner in New York City—yet it owns just 52 locations,
    a far cry from the hundred-fold branches that it operates.
</p>

<h3>Summing Land Ownership</h3>

<p>
    Another measure of "largest" is "owner of the most building area". This probably gets closer to the intent of the
    question, and so, using that metric, once again here is our top ten:
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/landowners/top-ten-largest-landowners-raw.png"
     class="inline_image" style="width:250px;" alt="Data."/>

<p>
    <b>The New York City Housing Authority and the Department of Education are easily the largest landowners in New
    York City</b>. Interestingly this means that there is 30% more affordable housing than public school to the city.
</p>

<p>
    If we combine "United States Of America" with all of the US Government sub-entities in the dataset—the National Park
    Service, USPS, etc.—it is probably the third largest landowner in the city. The National Park Service on its own
    is fourth largest.

    Filtering down to private entities once more:
