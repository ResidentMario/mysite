    <a href="http://www.residentmar.io/2016/09/14/citibike-map.html">Back in 2016 I mapped bike trips taken using New York City's bike-share system, Citi Bike</a>. I traded Brooklyn and Manhattan for Oakland and San Francisco in the meantime, so thought it'd be fitting to recreate that map in my updated setting.
</p>

<p>
    Here's one for San Francisco:

</a>

<p>
    And here's one for the East Bay:
</p>

</a>

<p>
    One major difference: New York City has many bike-able bridges, but the Bay Area has none. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transbay_Tube">a tunnel</a> for trains and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland_Bay_Bridge">a bridge</a> for cars but that's it. So whilst Brooklyn and Manhattan share their bikes, San Francisco and the East Bay operate entirely independently.
</p>

<p>
    And a caveat: this map uses idealized routes generated using the <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/">Open Route Service</a> (which in turn uses OpenStreetMap data). These routes may differ from the actual, perhaps more circuitous routes bikers take.
