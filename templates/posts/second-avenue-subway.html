<p>
    The first phase of the long-awaited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway">Second Avenue
    Subway</a> opened to the public just two weeks ago, bringing with it an end to a on-and-off-again funding saga
    going back to the line's original proposal in 1919â€”almost 90 years ago. The completed project adds three new
    stops on the East Side, partially relieving the pressure on the only other line there, 4/5/6 Lexington Avenue (not
    inconsequentially, the busiest line in the system).
</p>

<p>
    The completion of Phase 1 reignited a never really dormant conversation on the escalating cost and dysfunction of
    transportation megaprojects. The entire Second Avenue Subway at large was once estimated to need the equivalent of
    $2.4 billion in 2016 dollars; Phase 1 took $4.5 billion instead, and Phase 2, which will add a further three
    stops north of 96th Street, the funding for which is still being arranged, is to cost a cool $6 billion. Phases 3
    and 4 are still on the drawing table.
</p>

<p>
    To put that cost in context, here are some other New York City icons and megaprojects, new and old, in terms of
    how many of them the Second Avenue Subway Phase 2 could build.
