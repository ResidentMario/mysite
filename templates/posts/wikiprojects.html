<p>
    Active editors on Wikipedia nominally organize themselves using WikiProjects, gathering-places for users
    with similar editing interests and experiences which serve to help bind together the specific
    sub-populations in the Wikipedian editing community. The effectiveness of these WikiProjects, however, is highly
    variable. Some, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Military_history">WikiProject
    Military history</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Video games">WikiProject
    Video games</a> are highly active and well-organized discussion-board-cum-communities. Some, like my home
    projects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Volcanoes">WikiProject Volcanoes</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Hawaii">WikiProject Hawaii</a>, are moderately
    active, but can seem lifeless at times. And some, like <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Nudity">WikiProject Nudity</a> (!), are graveyards.
</p>

<p>
    At their best, WikiProjects help keep Wikipedians addicted: they provide friendly gathering spaces in which
    any of a number of users interested in a topic can discuss and coordinate their effects, creating a healthy
    communal atmosphere and a reason to stick with the project.
</p>

<p>
    For this project I set out to try to understand the way that WikiProjects interact with one another. Some of my
    questions were: how many WikiProjects are there? How big are they? And how do they link to one another?
</p>

<h3>Sizing it up</h3>

<p>
    Dealing with the haphazard way in which WikiProjects organize their data turned out to be vaguely Herculean, and
    over the course of working through this data I had to write in logic for more cases than I ever imaginedâ€•an
    object lesson on how difficult it can be to clean an unpurposed dataset. My "in" was the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team">1.0 assessment scale ratings</a>,
    which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WP_1.0_bot/Tables/Project/Africa">charts</a> data for all
    WikiProjects. A lot of grease and a ridiculous amount of API and page requests later, I rolled up a list
    of (almost?) every WikiProject and their sizes.
</p>

<p>
    WikiProjects keep track of the articles that they are responsible for with "tag templates", placed on article talk
    pages, which provide some quality and importance metrics about the article in question. I first ranked the
    WikiProjects and plotted them according to their size&mdash;that is, the number of articles that they have tagged
    in this manner:
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/wikiprojects/wikiproject_articles_tagged_linear.png"
     class="inline_image_full" alt="WikiProject X"/>

<p>
    WikiProject sizes are exponential distributed: there are a few very, very large WikiProjects which dominate
    everyone else. Exponential curves like this one are far and away the norm amongst measures of online
    communities: so much so that there is a colloquial term for it, called <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law">Zipf's law</a>, in the field of network analysis.
</p>
<p>
    This graph on its own is not very informative, however. We can get a better sense of what's going on by looking
    at a compressed view known as the log-log plot:
</p>

<img src="/static/post_assets/wikiprojects/wikiproject_articles_tagged_exponential.png"
     class="inline_image_full" alt="Logarithmic graph of article distribution."/>


<p>
    In red is the trend line that we would expect the WikiProjects to follow if they have a so-called Zipf-like
    distribution. Instead many large WikiProjects are larger-than-expected and many small ones are
    smaller-than-expected.
</p>

<p>
    I think that this data hints at the unbalanced way in which Wikipedians organize their article tagging
    campaigns. To see what I mean, here are the 25 largest WikiProjects and their sizes:

<p>
    Just from a cursory examination of this list you can already get a sense of the biases at play on Wikipedia. Put
    yourself in the midset of your typical Wikipedian: according to a
    <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Editor_Survey_2011">2011 Editor Survey</a> you are overwhelmingly white,
    English-speaking (at least on the English Wikipedia), male, and kind of a nerd (don't knock it 'til you try it!).
    What types of article are you more likely to be interested in: one on your local highway in Alberta or one on a
    village in Africa?
</p>

<p>
    And so it is that an entire continent (Africa) gets less than a fourth of coverage that the United States does,
    and only two thirds that of Australia, a country with on the order of a fiftieth of the population.
</p>

<p>
    This list also demonstrates some of the aforementioned quirks of the article tagging system. As of writing,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidoptera">WikiProject Lepidoptera</a>, an order of insects, has 98,042
    tagged
    articles, seemingly the work of a bot tagging campaign early in the project's history. This is enough to make it
    the thirteenth largest WikiProject on the English Wikipedia&mdash;yet its parent project, WikiProject Insects,
    has just 55,644 articles.
</p>
<p>
    Or look at WikiProject Military history, with 196,951 tagged articles: aren't these all a strict subset of
    WikiProject History, which has merely 36,324 of them?
</p>

<!--
<p>
    That's powerful. One of the things that I learned over the course of this project, however, is to take care with
    drawing conclusions based on WikiProject sizes. For instance, the Military history project is one of the largest
    on Wikipedia, with close to 200,000 articles. The History project, meanwhile, has 36,266. Why? Because there are
    far more editors interested in the specific subfield of military history than there are in history more broadly
    construed, and those editors have done a better job of curating their content
</p>
-->

<h3>Correlative strength</h3>

<p>
    Categorization was one of the most important meta-tasks in the early history of Wikipedia: Wikipedians then as
    now were very much interested in the how much and of what of their editing areas. Today the vast majority of
    Wikipedia articles are categorized according to WikiProject, most according to multiple ones: <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shield_volcano">Shield volcano</a>, for instance, is associated
    with WikiProjects in Volcanoes and Geology, while <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barack_Obama">Barrack Obama</a> has something like a dozen of them.
    I was interested in gauging the relative levels of overlap in content coverage for various WikiProjects. How
    often WikiProject Geology editors interact with WikiProject Mountains ones? How about WikiProject Alaska and
    WikiProject Glaciers?
</p>

<p>
    The following charts, generated by sampling tagged articles and checking
    their talk pages for interactions with other projects, provide a snapshot of what WikiProjects interact with one
    another the most. WikiProjects are measured by "correlation": that is, how often, on a scale of 0 to 1, that an
    article tagged by the project in question also happens to be tagged by this other one.
</p>

    A gallery of some of my favorites follows.

     class="inline_image_full" alt="WikiProject Mathematics correlations"/>

<p>
    Getting an unbiased sample of articles tagged a certain way proved to be challenging, so an important caveat
    needs to be made: the article samples used to calculate correlation for this project are biased towards
    high-importance, high-quality articles.
</p>

<p>
    That's all for now, folks!
