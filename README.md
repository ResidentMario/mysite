Between the data analysis projects that I run through and the software libraries that I tinker with, I write a lot of
 code. My personal website helps me keep track of things by giving me a space in which to ruminate on what I've done,
  where I'm going, and how I'm going to get there.

The service is written in [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
Posts themselves are written in raw HTML/CSS, though I may still investigate moving to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
in due time.

Huge shout-out to [Randal Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/) and to [Ben Wellington](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/),
in whom I find continual inspiration in my own weekend data hacks.
