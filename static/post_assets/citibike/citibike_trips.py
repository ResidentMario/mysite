        """
        This class initializer takes one of two different kinds of inputs in df, plus a valid Google maps client as
        the client paramater.

        The first kind of input---the one written for the purposes of generating bike-weeks in the original revision
        of this codebase---is what I call a delta DataFrame. This is DataFrame containing two Series corresponding
        with two adjacent trips in which the end point of the first trip does not match the start point of the
        second, implying that a rebalancing trip was made in between the two points.

        The second kind of input---generated later---is a single Series corresponding with a single precalculated
        rebalancing trip. That is, the expected input in this case is a Series with all of the expected parameters
        of the core dataset pre-filled. Note that in this case the name of the Series---the Series.name
        parameter---MUST be a unique id for the trip in question.

        Generating the data I need using the second mode requires significant preprocessing efforts but simplifies
        the codebase overall because it allows to know, when writing the data to the data store, how many more trips
        I need to run through the geocoder.

        Pre-filling requires running get_rebalancing_trip_path_time_estimate_tuple() head of time; for more details see
        notebook 06.

        Either way this class initializer assigns to the object a fully packaged GeoJSON representation. There are a
        lot of intermediate steps to this process. The GeoJSON representation must be built from scratch. Start time
        and stop time are computed to be exactly in the middle of the two surrounding trips.

        Compare with the far simpler `bike_tripper()`, which does the same thing for the it-turns-out far simpler case of
        actual bike trips.

        Parameters
        ----------
        delta: pd.DataFrame or pd.Series
            A pandas DataFrame containing a delta DataFrame (two adjacent bike trips with different start and end
            points). Alternatively, a single pandas Series containing the preprocessed trip.
